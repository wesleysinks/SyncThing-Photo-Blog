## Syncthing Photo Blog

# Goal: 
Pull photos and txt or md files with the same name to create continuous scrolling posts, sync to remote machine(s) with Syncthing from specified directory.

# Planned Features:

* Generate single post URL/slug
* Offer share links per post
* Preview text at bottom with opaque random colored background (possibly array? Themes?)
* Offer expand and minimize preview with small + | - buttons, show only a + in bottom left corner when in minimized mode for full photo view.
* Handle multiple directories as categories, authors, employees, sections, etc? Set a default directory for home, or have home pull in order of photo modification date.
* Add a subdomain on my home server and test functionality multi-platform (mobile, pc, etc.)
