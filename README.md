# Syncthing Photo Blog

## Goal:
Pull photos and txt or md files with the same name to create continuous scrolling posts, sync to remote machine(s) with Syncthing from specified directory.

## Planned Features:

* Generate single post URL/slug
* Offer share links per post
* Preview text at bottom with opaque random colored background (possibly array? Themes?)
* Offer expand and minimize preview with small + | - buttons, show only a + in bottom left corner when in minimized mode for full photo view.
* Handle multiple directories as categories, authors, employees, sections, etc? Set a default directory for home, or have home pull in order of photo modification date.
* Add a subdomain on my home server and test functionality multi-platform (mobile, pc, etc.)

## To Do:

- [x] Pull images and txt files from posts directory to home page
- [x] Test Syncthing with mobile device
- [x] Create single post display and link logic
- [ ] Add CSS to gallery for better UX
- [ ] Break out functions and includes
